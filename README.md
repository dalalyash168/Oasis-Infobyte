# TASK -1 Iris Flower Classification

This repository hosts code for training a machine learning model designed to classify Iris flowers by their measurements. The Iris flower dataset encompasses three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each with unique measurement profiles. The objective is to create a model capable of accurately categorizing Iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project is the renowned Iris flower dataset, frequently employed for classification purposes. It comprises measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, evenly distributed with 50 samples for each species. The dataset, named iris.csv, can be found within the repository.

## Libraries Required
<br>
NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib

## Model Training

The code for training the classification models can be found in the iris_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Three different models are trained:
<br>
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Each model is trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy

## Testing
After undergoing training, the models are assessed using a new test dataset comprising measurements of Iris flowers with unidentified species. The models make predictions about the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is then evaluated.
