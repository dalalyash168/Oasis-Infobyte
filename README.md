# TASK -1 Iris Flower Classification

This repository hosts code for training a machine learning model designed to classify Iris flowers by their measurements. The Iris flower dataset encompasses three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each with unique measurement profiles. The objective is to create a model capable of accurately categorizing Iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project is the renowned Iris flower dataset, frequently employed for classification purposes. It comprises measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, evenly distributed with 50 samples for each species. The dataset, named iris.csv, can be found within the repository.
